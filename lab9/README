lab8 - Santiago Larrain

Usage:
-----

$ make
Compiles the executables of server and client

$ make clean
Deletes both executables

$ ./server [PORT]
Starts the server. Optional argument defines the port number. Default is 1066
because of the Battle of Hastings.

$ ./client 127.0.0.1 port
Starts the client. It needs to specify the port as the first argument (has not
been tested outside a LAN) and the port as the second one. No defaults here.

Heuristic
---------

Following the suggestion on the lab8 instructions, the program checks with all 5
vowel possibilities in every vowel of the word.
For example:
Enter word: bot
Checks for: bat, bet, bit, bot, but. And returns them if any of them exist:
bat
bet
bit
but

Enter word: boit
Checks for: bait, beit, biit, boit, buit, boat, boet, boit, boot, bout.
bait
boat
boot
bout

Enter word: reciive
The word reciive is spelled incorrectly
receive

It suggests a maximum of 10 words. None is none is found.
